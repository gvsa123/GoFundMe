       "'It feels like the world has stopped, doesn’t it. Yet, I am very, very aware that I am here – in Calgary – with my family and neighbors, friends and others ( though virtually or\\xa0through significant social distancing! ) during this unprecedented time. As a photographer, I typically spend time capturing images of pets, individuals, families - capturing all of life’s moments. Those moments are still happening in homes right now. I know it. But I can’t be there to capture them. Like everyone, Calgary residents are doing their part to\\xa0stay at home.\\xa0Starting today, I am offering to take five minute ‘Front Steps Portraits” of Calgary’s furry residents.\\xa0\\xa0I am taking time out of my weekend (is the very one on an extended weekend?!) to scurry around town and snap super fast images of your furry pals and their families on your front steps.\\xa0You will know when I am coming. You can step outside, where I’ll be standing near your driveway\\xa0or street, at least 10 feet away. I’ll take a couple quick shots and leave. I physically interact with no one (not even the furry residents - inner cry), and touch nothing, during these sessions.\\xa0However, I *do* smile and laugh with you, and don’t we all need a little bit of that right now? After your quick session, I will email you the digital file of your portrait.\\xa0 In exchange, I am asking you to make a good faith donation to Pawsitive Match Rescue Foundation. Suggested donation is $50 but any amount is appreciated as I know times are tough on all of us right now #albertastrong. I will be posting these images on Facebook and Instagram using the hashtag #thefrontstepsproject.\\xa0 Please share these posts. Let’s spread the word and foster a community! The purpose of this project is to bring us together when we might feel isolated.\\xa0 I aim to highlight those furry faces of our community during a time when we might not see them in passing at the doggy park, daycare, or pet friendly coffee shop. Participating in this project is also an opportunity to step up to help those who need it most right now in Calgary.\\xa0To be clear:\\xa0I will be taking images outside ONLY and from at least 10 feet away. Our session will be brief, likely just 5 minutes. This is not a typical get-dressed-up-and-pose-for-the-photographer session. Want to stand outside in your pajamas and slippers? Sounds good to me. Suited up for a nice long dog walk? Love it!\\xa0\\xa0Be you. \\xa0\\n\\n*******More information about Pawsitive Match Rescue Foundation Adoptions: Pawsitive Match saves dogs and cats facing life-threatening circumstances in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Many animals in our program come from shelters that have no choice but to euthanize due to over-crowding or because they are shutting down, as well as stray animals that have no home. We also help save animals in local rural areas and on a case by case basis, we may assist with owner surrenders. In many cases we are the only hope these cats and dogs have, as many shelters come to us when they'"
